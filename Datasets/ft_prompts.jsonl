As sad as this is; it was on Christmas. \nIt all started a few Christmas' ago. I am not sure how long ago it was, but I have to say it was a few years ago. You see, my family has this rule that we are not allowed to open presents til seven o'clock. This rule is easy to uphold, usually, though instead of waking up at my normal six-thirty, I woke up and it was four-fifteen! \nJust like any little kid on Christmas, my first thought was to sneek downstairs and try to figure out what was in my presents. I knew better, though, I knew that if I was to sneek down to try to figure out my presents I would get in trouble. That was not how I wanted to spend my Christmas, so I decided to read, play with toys, and color to pass the time. \nThe minutes went by none to fast. Every minute felt like a hour, every hour felt like a decade! It reminded me of those movies where time would slow down and sometimes even stop. \nAs time wore on, the thought to sneek and take a peek at my presents sounded ever more apealing. Several more minutes wore by... at that moment. I decided enough was enough! So, I did something that I would regret later. I snuck down stairs! \nIt was not hard. In seconds I was at the Christmas tree. I went to grab my first present when suddenly I acsententally hit a big present that made a loud noise! Emmedially my mom awoke to find me red handed! \nAs a result to my actions, my family was not allowed to open presents til eight o'clock! It makes me now think that when someone is not patient, it is like they are acting selfish and only thinking about themselves. \nNow I know it means to be patient.
